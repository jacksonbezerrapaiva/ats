##              O_DIRECT Specific Configuration            ##
#############################################################
#
# Examples: Using O_DIRECT on disks (Linux kernel >= 2.6.3,
# FreeBSD > 5.3)
#
#      /dev/disc/by-id/[Insert_ID_Here_12345]                   # Linux
#      /dev/disc/by-path/[Insert-Path-Here:12:34:56-1.0.0.0]    # Linux
#
#      /dev/ada1                                                # FreeBSD
#
# Note that disks are identified by id or path. This is to prevent changes
# by the kernel (which could occur if a disk was simply described as /dev/sda, sdb, etc.).
#
# Also note that when using these raw devices in O_DIRECT mode, you
# do not need to specify the partition size. It's automatically
# detected.
#
# A small default cache (256MB). This is set to allow for the regression test to succeed
# most likely you'll want to use a larger cache. And, we definitely recommend the use
# of raw devices for production caches.
